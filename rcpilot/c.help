C - Compute

Syntax:
  C:var=expr
  C:$var=sexpr

  This command will allow you to perform computations.  In the first form
the value of the expression evaluation will be written to var.  In the
second form the string concatenation of sexpr will be written to the
string variable specified by $var

Samples:
  C:i=(2+3*(4+5))*3             - Would end up setting i to 87

  C:$s="Hello "+$name           - Would set $s to 'Hello ' plus whatever
                                  is in $name
