USR(address)
USR(address,expr)

  The USR function is used to call a machine language subroutine.  The address
argument is required in both versions and specifies the address of the ML
routine to be executed.  If the second argument is provided, this value will
be loaded into RF prior to the ML routine being called.  The return value of
this function is the value in RF when the ML routine returns.
