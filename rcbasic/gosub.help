GOSUB expr

  The GOSUB command allows normal program execution to be interrupted so that
a subroutine could be executed.

  Like GOTO, Rc/Basic allows for computed GOSUB.  Example: GOSUB B*100

  If the target line of GOSUB does not exist, then an error 3 will result.

  When a RETURN command is encountered, program execution will continue with
the statement following the GOSUB.
