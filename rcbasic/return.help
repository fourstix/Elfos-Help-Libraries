RETURN

  This command will return execution back to the statement following the last
executed GOSUB command.

  If there are no more GOSUB targets left on the stack then an error 4 will
result and the program will be terminated.

Example:

10 PRINT "A"
20 GOSUB 100
30 PRINT "C"
99 END
100 PRINT "B"
110 RETURN

RUN
     A
     B
     C
