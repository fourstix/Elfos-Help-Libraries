(EVAL arg)

  This function applies the LISP evaluator to arg.

Examples:

(EVAL '(CAR '(A B C)))
     A

(SET 'A '(CDR '(A B C)))
(EVAL A)
     (B C)
(EVAL 'A)
     (CDR '(A B C))
  In the first EVAL, all arguments that are not quoted are already EVAL'd
so A will produce the (CDR '(A B C)) which EVAL then evaluates to get (C D).
In the second case, since A is quoted it is not evaluated first so now
EVAL will simply produce what A is bound to.
