(PRINT arg)

  This function prints the value of arg to the terminal.

Examples:

(PRINT '(A B C))
     (A B C)
     (A B C)

(SET 'A '(C D E))
(PRINT A)
     (C D E)
     (C D E)

  The reason why each of these examples is printing the result twice is
because the PRINT command is printing its argument and also returns its
argument as a the result, the LISP eval loop always displays the last
return value.
