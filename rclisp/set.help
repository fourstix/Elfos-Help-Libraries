(SET arg1 arg2)

  The SET command will bind arg2 to arg1.  arg1 must evaluate to an atom.

Examples:

(SET 'A '(A B C))
     (A B C)

(SET 'A 'B)
     B

(SET (CAR '(C D E)) '(A B))
     (A B)
(EVAL 'C)
     (A B)
  This last example shows how the LISP evaluator evaluates areguments.
SET requires arg1 to be an atom, in this example arg1 was (CAR '(C D E)),
this gets evaluated and results in the atom of C, which is then bound to
(A B)
