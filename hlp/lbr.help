Usage: lbr {option} {file [file ...]}

Add files to library:
lbr a libname file [file ... ]

List files in library:
lbr l libname

Extract files from library:
lbr e libname

.lbr is assumed as the filetype for libname and should NOT be included
in the names in the above commands.  Wildcards are NOT currently supported.
Currently E extracts all files, but eventually it will be possible to
extract just a specified list of files.
