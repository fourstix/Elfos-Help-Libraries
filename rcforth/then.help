THEN     ( -- )           - THEN portion of IF-ELSE-THEN

  THEN ends the IF-ELSE-THEN structure.  On a failed test at IF, execution
will continue following the matching THEN.  If an ELSE block is also defined
for the IF, then if the test succeeds, execution will follow the IF up to
the matching ELSE block and then the ELSE block will be skipped to continue
after the matching THEN.

Examples:

    ok 1 IF 1 . ELSE 2 . THEN 3 . CR
    1 3

    ok 0 IF 1 . ELSE 2 . THEN 3 . CR
    2 3
