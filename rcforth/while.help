WHILE    (B -- )          - Beginning of while-repeat loop

Examples:

Another uncontrolled loop is the WHILE REPEAT loop.  This loop has its
test at the beginning, therefore if WHILE finds a 0 on the stack the loop
will not even execute the first time:

    ok 5 DUP WHILE DUP . 1 - DUP REPEAT CR
    5 4 3 2 1 
    ok 0 DUP WHILE DUP . 1 - DUP REPEAT CR
    ok
