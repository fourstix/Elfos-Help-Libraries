UNTIL    (B -- )          - Ending of BEGIN-UNTIL loop

Examples:

The BEGIN-UNTIL loop type is uncontrolled, the loop is executed so long as
the top of stack is non-zero at the time of test.  The BEGIN UNTIL loop
has its test at the end, and therefore just like DO loops, the loop will
always be executed at least once:

    ok 5 BEGIN DUP . 1 - DUP UNTIL CR
    5 4 3 2 1
    ok
