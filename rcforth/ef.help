EF        ( -- v )          - Read status of EF input lines

  This function reads the status of all 4 EF inputs and produces a sum
of their states.  The EF lines will add the following values to the sum:

    EF1  - 1
    EF2  - 2
    EF3  - 4
    EF4  - 8

Example:
    
    EF . CR
    0
    ok

Note: The result from EF will depend on what hardware is attached to your
machine and what they are currently asserting on the 1802 EF lines.
