Rc/Mouse defines 512 variables, indexed from 0 through 511.  The uppercase
letters A-Z when encountered in a program will push the values 0-25, 
corresponding to the letter's position in the alphabet onto the stack.  In
this way the first 26 variables are named from A-Z, the remaining variables
can only be accessed by address

The lowercase letters will also translate to 0-25 and are therefore not
seperate variable indexes from the uppercase letters
